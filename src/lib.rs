//! # Macros to run bash scripts inline in Rust
//!
//! In many cases it's convenient to run child processes,
//! particularly via Unix shell script.  Writing the
//! Rust code to use `std::process::Command` directly
//! will get very verbose quickly.  You can generate
//! a script "manually" by using e.g. `format!()` but
//! there are some important yet subtle things to get right,
//! such as dealing with quoting issues.
//!
//! This macro takes Rust variable names at the start
//! that are converted to a string (quoting as necessary)
//! and bound into the script as bash variables.
//!
//! Further, the generated scripts use "bash strict mode"
//! by default, i.e. `set -euo pipefail`.
//!
//! ```
//! use sh_inline::*;
//! let foo = "variable with spaces";
//! bash!(r#"test "${foo}" = 'variable with spaces'"#, foo)?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! This generates and executes bash script as follows:
//! ```sh
//! set -euo pipefail
//! foo="variable with spaces"
//! test ${foo} = 'variable with spaces'
//! ```
